# Quivers - Official Website

A modern, responsive website for **Quivers**, the cathartic jangle pop band from Melbourne, Australia. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About Quivers

Quivers have been creating cathartic jangle pop for long enough to receive support from Pitchfork, NPR, JJJ, and even R.E.M., who once sent fire emojis in their DMs. The band has performed at major festivals including Dark Mofo, Meadow, Boogie, and SXSW, and filmed a session for Seattle's beloved KEXP station. They've supported acts like The Hold Steady, Sonny & the Sunsets, and Methyl Ethel.

Their latest album **"Oyster Cuts"** was released worldwide via Merge Records on August 9th, 2024, featuring a tougher and more expansive pop sound with both Bella and Sam sharing singing duties.

_"It's the sound of bedsit 1980s college-rock thrust into the big-tent environs of 21st-century indie, like a Go-Betweens with Coachella-conquering ambitions or a Smiths with greater pub sing-along appeal. And it's absolutely glorious."_ - **Pitchfork**
